# IntroductionToEmbeddedSystems

## About This Repository 
The repository compiles projects, assignments, and labs from my Embedded Systems course, which covered the following concept: CPU, registers, buses, memory, I/O interfaces, number systems (Sub-Topics: arithmetic and information representation), assembly language programming (Sub-Topics: addressing techniques, arithmetic and logic operations, branching and looping, stack operations, procedure calls, parameter passing). 

## Learning Outcomes
1. Ability to perform number base conversions, integer arithmetic, specify range and
precision and detect overflow when using signed and unsigned fixed-point number systems.
2. Ability to use efficient special case alternatives for fixed and floating-point arithmetic
computations informed by an in-depth understanding of binary arithmetic and number
representations.
3. Ability to write functions in assembly that are optimized for speed or memory (or both),
informed by an understanding of instruction representation, instruction pipelining, and
memory alignment.
4. Ability to use the bit manipulation features of assembly language to test, insert, extract,
and modify bit fields within a packed representation
